# user.js
Firefox [user.js](http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file) settings file  
  
These settings are mostly cosmetic and privacy related.
I don't believe in changing "performance" settings. If they were beneficial, Firefox would ship them by default. Most of the time, they cause more harm than good.
  
  
**IMPORTANT** - Once an entry for a preference setting exists in the user.js file, any change you make to that setting in the options and preference dialogs or via about:config will be lost when you restart your Mozilla application because the user.js entry will override it.
